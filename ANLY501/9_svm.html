            <section id="chia-summary">
                <p>In this section, svm model is used to predict whether the stock(offer count) of drive is impacted by Chia coin. From the visualization and analysis above, the conclusion is listed below:</p>
                <p>1. Around <b>40%</b> drives are impacted on stock by Chia. </p>
                <p>2. Their marketplace offer counts slumped during April~August in 2021. </p>
                <p>3. Average stocks of the impacted drives is significantly larger than not impacted ones.</p>

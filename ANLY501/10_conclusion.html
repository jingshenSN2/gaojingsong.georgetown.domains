        <h2>2. Conclusion</h2>
        <h2>2.1 What we found in this portfolio?</h2>
        <section id="conclusion">

            <p>At the beginning of this portfolio, 10 questions are asked to support us understand the current PC hardware shortage. Now, it's time to see how they've been answered. </p>

        <h2>2.2 Answer Questions</h2>
        <section id="ans-q1">
        <p><b>1 How does the supply and price of PC components change?</b></p>
        <p>
            PC hardware have different trends of prices. Most CPUs' prices maintain stable. GPU and drives are impacted by cryptocurrencies with a large proportion of these productsâ€˜ prices skyrocketed since pandemic and crypto-boom.
        </p>
            <p>
                In the figure below, price time series of the PC hardware are separated into 6 cluster. Cluster 2,3 are CPU products that have stable price trend. Cluster 5 is drives that impacted by Chia coin which show little spikes on the right side of graph. Cluster 1, 6 are GPU products that the prices skyrocketed since pandemic.

        <section id="ans-q2">
        <p><b>2 How does the supply and price of raw materials change?</b></p>
            <p>
                Since the pandemic, suffered from the shutdown of factories, most raw material that used to manufacture PC hardware showed a tremendous increment in their prices.

        <p><b>3 How does the price of cryptocurrencies change?</b></p>
            <p>
                Since the pandemic, most cryptocurrencies also showed a great increment(crypto-boom) in their prices since pandemic. Also, there's another crypto-boom happened in 2018.
            </p>

        <p><b>4 What's the relation between the market of cryptos and the price of graphic cards?</b></p>
        <p>
            The analysis shows that the price change of graphic cards are very similar to the price change of cryptocurrencies. A events chain could happen like below:
        </p>
            <p>Crypto price rises => more miners buy graphic cards to mine crypto => scalpers buy cards and sell them at high price to those miners => graphic cards are out of stock & the price of graphic cards skyrocket</p>

        <p><b>5 Does Chia coin caused a significant change in the supply and price of SSD and HDD?</b></p>
        <p>
            From the data, Chia caused 2/3 drives to suffer from price raise and 1/3 drives to suffer from supply shortage. The analysis shows that drives with small capacity(128~256gb) and very large capacity(8tb, 10tb+) are more likely to be impacted by Chia.

        <p>This question has not been fully answered by this portfolio. For now, the analysis shows that the prices of Intel's CPUs are <b>lower</b> after AMD released their Zen3 CPUs, but the prices of AMD's CPUs are <b>higher</b> after Intel released their 10th gen CPUs.</p>

        <h2>3. Further Research</h2>
        <section id="cpu">
        <p><b> A New CPU-mined Crypto: RTM -- will it be a disaster of CPU market?</b></p>
            <p>Raptoreum(RTM), a new cryptocurrency that featured with only CPU-mining. This crypto claims that using CPU to mine will create a more fair environment for miners since graphic cards are too expensive. </p>
            <p>However, as we know, just like Chia coin, this crypto can easily cause the price of CPU significantly increase. Further research can be focused on this crypto and see how will it affect the market of CPU.</p>

        <h2>2. YouTube Comments Sentiment Analysis</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Preparation and Filtering GPU-related Comments</h3>
            <section id="yt-pre">
                <p>In the previous parts, YouTube comments are classified into 5 topics using different models. In this part, the project will focus on only one topic: <b>GPU topic</b>. A simple sentiment classification and analysis will be performed on these comments to see how do the public react to the GPU shortage.</p>
                <p>First, 3363 comments under GPU topic are filtered from the origin YouTube comments dataset. Then a small subset contains 300 comments is selected as training set and manually labeled. The labels are 0 as Neutral(126 in this class), 1 as Negative(96 in this class), 2 as Positive(78 in this class). The rest 3063 GPU topic comments are used as test set.</p>
            </section>

        <h3>2.2 Sentiment Analysis</h3>
            <section id="yt-word">
                <p>A naive bayes model is trained by word-tokenized (TfidfVectorizer) training set. The confusion matrices are shown below.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Summary of Sentiment Analysis by Naive Bayes</h3>
            <section id="yt-summary">
                <p>These plots show a trend of public view about graphic cards. Three main findings are shown below: </p>
                <p>1. It is very obvious that since June 2020, when the crypto market began to skyrocket, the public began to hold very negative view of the GPU to complain about the shortage.</p>
                <p>2. An interesting find is that there is another peak of negative view occurred in 2018, which is also a small boom of crypto ETH, the price of ETH risen from $100 at January to over $300 at June. </p>
                <p>3. During later 2018 to early 2020, the public view of the GPU were kind of neutral and even positive for a few months. In this period, the market of crypto was also kind of slump, which the price of ETH was struggling and bouncing between $100 to $300 many times. </p>
                <p>Based on these observations, there's a <b>correlation between the public view and the market of cryptocurrencies</b>, which can be explained by the following event chain:  </p>
                <p>The price of crypto rises => more miners buy graphic cards to mine crypto => scalpers buy cards and sell them at high price to those miners => graphic cards are out of stock & the price of graphic cards skyrocket => people complain about the shortage and high price.</p>

        <h2>3. Impact from Chia on Drives Price</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Why drive & chia?</h3>
            <section id="chia-pur">
                <p>As mentioned in the introduction, Chia is a special cryptocurrency which uses the storage of drives (hdd or ssd) instead of graphic cards to mine. So, after it opened for public trading in April 2021, instead of affect the graphic card market, it has an impact on drive storage market. In this part, the impact of Chia will be evaluated using the historical price of more than 200 drives on Amazon since 2021.</p>
            </section>

        <h3>3.2 Feature Extraction</h3>
            <section id="chia-pre">
                <p>Since most drives have already been on the market for many years, the prices of them change very slow, even during the Chia Impact period. So, a monthly price is used for tracking the price trend in 2021. </p>
                <p>Monthly prices <b>from February to October</b> are extracted from the Amazon database and normalized by divide by the price in January. The <b>brand</b>, <b>drive_type</b>, <b>drive_subtype</b>, and <b>capacity</b> are also extracted from database and used as features.</p>
                <p>Then, 60 drives are selected as training set and manually labeled whether their prices are affected by Chia (by looking at the entire daily price history using Keepa API). As a result, 32 drives are labeled as 1 (IMPACT) and 28 drives are labeled as 0 (NO IMPACT). </p>

            </section>

        <h3>3.3 Model Training & Effect Analysis</h3>
            <section id="chia-anly">
                <p>First, a naive bayes model is then trained by the training set, the confusion matrix is shown below.</p>
                <figure style="width:90%">
                    <img class="center-fig" style="width:60%" src="picture/naive_bayes/nb_train.png">

                </figure>
                <p>The key features of this model are shown below.</p>
                <figure style="width:70%">
                    <img class="center-fig" style="width:70%" src="picture/naive_bayes/record_feat_impt.png">

                    </figurecaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The accuracy of model is 80.0%, which shows a great classification power of CHIA IMPACT. Then the model is used on the test set to predict whether a drive was impacted by Chia. As a result, 142 drives in test set are labeled as 1 (IMPACT) and 84 drives are labeled as 0 (NO IMPACT). </p>
                <p>Next, some factors of drives are visualized according to the label CHIA_IMPACT. </p>
                <p>First is the type of drives, there are 2 main types: HDD(hard disk drive) and SSD(solid state drive). HDD has two disk sizes as subtypes: 2.5 inches(as 25) and 3.5 inches(as 35). SSD has three socket sizes as subtypes: SATA(as sata), m.2 SATA(as m2), and m.2 NVME(as nvme). </p>
                <p>To check whether the impacted drives have different distribution on each type, two chisq.test are performed. The results show that the distribution does vary by subtypes.</p>
                <figure style="width:70%">
                    <img class="center-fig" src="picture/naive_bayes/test_type.png">

                <p>From the jitter plot, 3.5 inches HDD and SATA SSD are mostly impacted by Chia. Other three subtypes are 50-50 impacted by Chia.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>For the price of drives(at January 2021), the drives which are impacted have a lower average prices.</p>

        <h3>3.4 Summary of Effect Analysis on Drive & Chia using Naive Bayes</h3>
            <section id="chia-summary">
                <p>In this section, naive bayes model is used to predict whether the price of drive is impacted by Chia coin. From the visualization and analysis above, the conclusion is listed below:</p>
                <p>1. Around <b>2/3</b> drives are impacted by Chia. Their prices spiked during April~August in 2021. </p>
                <p>2. All types of drives are somehow impacted by Chia, especially the SATA SSD and 3.5 inches HDD. </p>
                <p>3. Drives are impacted no matter which manufacturer sells them. But some certain brands have more drives that been affected.</p>
                <p>4. Average price of the impacted drives is smaller than not impacted ones.</p>
                <p>5. Drives with small capacity(128~256gb) and very large capacity(8tb, 10tb+) are mostly impacted by Chia.</p>
                <p>In the next part, a similar impact analysis on the stock of drive will be performed using SVM. </p>

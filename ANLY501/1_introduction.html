            <p>Many tech fans love to build their PC instead of buying a pre-built one from the manufacturer. Building a
                PC by hand gives people free rein to customize every component according to their needs. They can save
                the cost of assembly and buy components on discount individually. </p>

            <p>However, things have changed a lot since 2020. The price of PC components, especially graphic cards,
                jumped incredibly. When a new graphic card hits the market, it is either out of stock from the beginning
                or immediately sold out. People have to pay double or even triple MSRP(<b>M</b>anufacturer's <b>S</b>uggested
                <b>R</b>etail <b>P</b>rice) to get one from scalpers.</p>

            <p>Before jumping into this problem, let's introduce the main parts of a computer first. A typical modern
                personal computer consists of several main electronic components: CPU, motherboard, graphic card(or GPU,
                <b>G</b>raphic <b>P</b>rocess <b>U</b>nit), and storage. </p>

            <p><b>CPU</b>: <b>C</b>entral <b>P</b>rocess <b>U</b>nit, the main computing center of the computer. Most
                consumer-grade CPU is manufactured by two company - Intel and AMD.</p>

            <p><b>Motherboard</b>: a platform that provide right sockets to connect each component in the computer.
                ASRock, ASUS, EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI are 5 top motherboard manufacturers.</p>

            <p><b>Graphic Card</b>: the part that render graphs and show the monitor. Sometimes, it's also called as
                GPU, <b>G</b>raphic <b>P</b>rocess <b>U</b>nit. To make things clear, the term GPU in this research
                refers to the silicon chip inside the graphic card. Most GPU is manufactured by two companies - AMD and
                NVIDIA. But there are at least 9 graphic card manufacturers(ASUS, EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, Sapphire, XFX,
                ZOTAC, also AMD and NVIDIA themselves). They buy chips from AMD and NVIDIA and make graphic card
                products with different power and cooling setups.</p>

            <p><b>Storage</b>: the drives that store data, HDD(<b>H</b>ard-<b>D</b>isk <b>D</b>drive) and SSD(<b>S</b>olid-<b>S</b>tate
                <b>D</b>rive). While HDD stores data on disks and access data with a probe, SSD stores data on DRAM
                chips and access data with the main control chip. Typically, HDD has a larger capacity and slower speed
                than SSD. Most HDD is made by three companies - Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. But there are
                more than 20 SSD manufacturers including ADATA, Crucial, Kingston, Samsung, SanDisk, Seagate, SK Hynix,
                and Western Digital.</p>

            <p>More technical details of these components will be discussed in other parts of the research.</p>

            <h2>2. Factors that Affect the PC components' Price</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Raw Material Supply</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic impacts so many industries. Many raw material producers were shut down during the
                pandemic. The total production was much lower which caused the price of raw material to keep going up.
                For example, compare to 2019 Q4, the price of copper increased by 50%, the price of single-crystal
                silicon wafer almost doubled.</p>


            <h3>2.2 Market Demand</h3>
            <p>During the pandemic, many people began to work from home, so they need to buy a new laptop or desktop.
                Many companies transferred their services to the cloud which means data centers had to upgrade their
                computing power and storage. The high demands caused a severe supply shortage which also lead the price
                of PC components to increase.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Cryptocurrency</h3>
            <p>Since Bitcoin first came out in 2014, a huge financial market of cryptocurrencies was formed. One of the
                PC components, graphic cards, are used to mine some cryptocurrencies such as ETH(ethernum). When
                the price of those cryptocurrencies goes up, miners buy more graphic cards to mine them, so the price of
                graphic cards raises up. When the cryptocurrency market collapse, miners all undersell their cards, so
                the price of graphic cards go down. Unlike the pandemic, the slump of the cryptocurrency market is
                cyclical and happened multiple times. So it might be a reference to future graphics card price
                trends.</p>

            <p>In April 2021, a new cryptocurrency Chia which is mined by storage came out which caused the price of HDD
                and SSD to increase. This is also a particular event worth noting.</p>

            <h3>2.4 Sale Strategies</h3>
            <p>Besides the recent impact of the pandemic and cryptocurrency, the sale strategies of manufacturers play
                an important role in the price of PC components. For example, some manufacturers offer large discounts
                on Black Friday while others only offer a little, and some manufacturers lower their last generation
                product after a new generation came out. DIYers always have questions like "when is the best time for me
                to buy the component", "should I buy the latest generation as soon as it comes out?". A better
                understanding of pricing strategies will help them make a better decision when they buy components.</p>

            <h2>3. Questions about this Data Science Problem and the Direction of Research</h2>

            <p>To fully understand this complicated data science problem of pricing, it can be separated into small questions below. The research will follow this question list as a direction. Question 1~6 are
                about the three external factors mentioned before. If there is a correlation between them and the price,
                these factors can be used to make a prediction on some kinds of PC components. Question 7~10 are about
                some pricing strategies of manufacturers which can help DIYers to make a better decision when building a
                PC.</p>

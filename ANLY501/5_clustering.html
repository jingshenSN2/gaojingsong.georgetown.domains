        <h2>1. PC Component Price Time Series (Python Record Data)</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Pre-classification of PC components</h3>

        <section id="pc-pre">

            <p>The python script for this part is <a
                    href="https://github.com/jingshenSN2/GU-ANLY-501-FALL-2021/blob/master/data_clean/amazon/timeseries_converter.ipynb">data_clean/amazon/timeseries_converter.ipynb</a>.
                All the preprocessed time series can be found at <a
                        href="https://github.com/jingshenSN2/GU-ANLY-501-FALL-2021/tree/master/data/amazon">data/amazon</a>
                folder on GitHub (see below for the definition of each file).</p>

            <p>Data in amazon database is recorded in <b>unequal-interval</b> time series, since Keepa API write a new
                value to their database <b>only</b> when the price changes.</p>

            <p>So, the first step of preprocessing is to rebuild a <b>equal-interval</b> time series from the database.
                <b>Pandas</b> is a useful tool to do this. Since it not only provides a SQL interface but also provides
                a powerful function called <b>resample</b>. With Pandas, histrotical price data in SQLite database can
                be easilty converted into equal-interval time series. <b>After several attempts, the time interval for
                    resampling is assigned to 1 day</b>.</p>

            <table width="100%">
                <caption>File prefix in pre-classified data and their meaning</caption>
                <tr>
                    <th>File Prefix</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>NEWS</td>
                    <td>price history of the New in marketplace</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>USED</td>
                    <td>price history of the Used in marketplace</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>BUY_BOX</td>
                    <td>price history of the New buy box</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>EBAY_NEW</td>
                    <td>price history of the lowest new price on the respective eBay locale</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>EBAY_USED</td>
                    <td>price history of the lowest used price on the respective eBay locale</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Another thing needs to be considered is that Keepa API uses <b>-1</b> as out-of-stock, but these negative
                values will disturb the following clustering. Therefore, all <b>-1</b>s in the time series are filled
                with a previous non-negative value to create a <b>normal price time series</b>.</p>

            <p>But the out-of-stock data does contain some useful information, so a new time series called <b>out-of-stock
                indicator</b> that records the out-of-stock status is created, which all normal prices are converted
                into 0 and out-of-stock values are converted into 1. </p>

            <p>Since the products are released in varied date, some products have data more than 4 years, but some
                products only have data less than 6 months. A pre-classification is performed on the products, all data
                are separated into different files based on their time span. The files are labeled by some suffixes.</p>

            <table width="100%">
                <caption>File suffix in pre-classified data and their meaning</caption>
                <tr>

                    <th>Meaning</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>s</td>
                    <td>time span less than 6 months</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>6m</td>
                    <td>time span bewteen 6 months to 1 year</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1y</td>
                    <td>time span bewteen 1 year to 2 years</td>

                    <td>4y</td>

                    <td>time series, each row contains a time series of out-of-stock indicators separate by space.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>eqts</td>
                    <td>time seires of normal prices but are truncated to same length.</td>
                </tr>

            <p>Because some distance metrics in the following clustering require a equal-length time series, so time
                series all have a truncated version. For example, <a
                        href="https://github.com/jingshenSN2/GU-ANLY-501-FALL-2021/blob/master/data/amazon/BUY_BOX_eqts_1y.txt">BUY_BOX_eqts_1y.txt</a>
                contains the same products as <a
                        href="https://github.com/jingshenSN2/GU-ANLY-501-FALL-2021/blob/master/data/amazon/BUY_BOX_ts_1y.txt">BUY_BOX_ts_1y.txt</a>,
                but the time spans of the data are truncated to exactly 1 year.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Clustering on unequal-length Time Series (KMeans, metric: DTW)</h3>

        <section id="pc-uneq">

            <p>The pre-classified datasets are not unequal-length time series. For example, the length of time series in

                can vary from 360(1 year) to 719(2 year).</p>
